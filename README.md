- Double / triple check [each connection](https://mmmonkey.co.uk/xstation-sony-playstation-install-notes-and-pinout/), from the alt-point to the FFC connector point on the picostation board, [PCB pinout](https://ibb.co/mDNDc8C)
- [Compile](https://shawnhymel.com/2096/how-to-set-up-raspberry-pi-pico-c-c-toolchain-on-windows-with-vs-code/) code, or use latest release
- Upload picostation.uf2 to your Raspberry Pi Pico (press Bootsel while you plug usb cable)
- Drop your bin/cue files on your SD Card (named UNIROM.bin / UNIROM.cue | UNIROM.cue must point to UNIROM.bin)

### Notes
- For the moment, Game/app loading is not consistent, you'll need to try several times
- If using an out of region bin/cue, you may need to use freepsxboot to bypass the region check
